http://hackage.haskell.org/package/typed-regex

Provides a quasi-quoter for regular expressions which
yields a tuple, of appropriate arity and types,
representing the results of the captures.  Allows the user 
to specify parsers for captures as inline Haskell.  Can 
also be used to provide typeful pattern matching in
function definitions and case patterns.

To build / install:

chmod ugo+x Setup.hs
./Setup.hs configure --user

See the haddock or Text/Regex/PCRE/QQT.hs for documentation.
